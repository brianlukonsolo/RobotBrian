# RobotBrian
A personal Lua project in which I attempt to create many robot clones of myself.

- My robot clones will obey me!
- My Lua code will be neat and maintainable!
- My robot clones will be intelligent!
- Behold, the power of Lua!

To behold my power and that of my clones, clone this project and open it in a Lua IDE of your choice, then run Application.lua >:)
